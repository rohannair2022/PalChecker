# About 
PalChecker is an interactive daily checker for tracking and maintaining a good lifestyle to balance mental health. It gives the user a way to reflect on their day by posing questions about it, which has been shown to increase emotional controlâ€”a crucial skill for managing stress, anxiety, and depression. The user creates a feeling of routine in their life by responding to the question every day, which has been shown to lessen anxiety and other issues. The score that the website offers gives the user a way to assess how their days are going and gives them motivation to improve.

        - **Ideation Solution**
          - Chose the topic of mental health and found an impending problem of individuals not having a way to assess how their days are going. Therefore, decided to devise the idea of PalChecker.
        - **Wireframes**
          - Used Balsamiq to design the wireframes of the website based on the idea of simplicity with the help of Preet.
        - **External Research**
          - Found the dataset for the machine learning model on Kaggle.

          - Additionally I also researched on color psychology to provide insights on what color is best suited for the website based on various factors.
        - **Video creation and Slides Presentation**
          - Created a comprehensive video of what the project is about, what problem it intends to solve and a walkthrough demo of the project.
            
  4) ### Preet Patel  :  Front-end (JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS)
        - **Interactive Chat Interface**
          - Developed a dynamic chat interface that guides users through mental health-related questions with a typing effect for enhanced engagement.
        - **User Input Handling and Validation**
          - Set up event listeners for rating buttons and submit buttons, ensuring only one rating is selectable 
            at a time and validating user responses.
        - **Welcome and Submission Messages**
          - Created functions to display a welcoming message at the start and an appropriate submission message at the
            end of the questionnaire.
        - **Data Submission and Analytics Display**
          - Implemented functionality to send user responses to the server and display personalized analytics
